# Publication_List
This program creates an abstract base class with two subclasses derived from the base class. 
The main instantiates three Publication objects, and adds them to a vector. The main then iterates
through the vector and calls the toString method depending on the object's class. The base class
toString method is declared as virtual, so that the derived classes may override it.
